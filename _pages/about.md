I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the University of Brasilia, Brazil. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I undertook postdoctoral studies in Statistics at McMaster University, Canada, under the supervision of Prof. N. Balakrishnan. My research interests include financial econometrics, machine learning and computational statistics. 

<!--I serve as an Associate Editor for the Journal of Applied Statistics, Journal of Statistical Theory and Practice, and Chilean Journal of Statistics.-->
